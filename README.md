## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

In this project I learned how to create custom properties and used them inside the var() functions. I understood the basics of Flexbox, and how divs can help you wrap your content in order to style your components better. I want to mention the fact that I wasn't getting the result I was expecting with the QR component because I hadn't added this line of code:

```css
body {
 height: 100vh;
}
```
The QR component wasn't centered, so with that line of code you are setting the height of the body page to be 100% of the viewport height.

### Continued development

I would like to continue focusing on using Flexbox, and custom CSS properties in order to understand them better. 

### Useful resources

- [CSS-TRICKS](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me understand better the Flexbox. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [mdn web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout/Basic_concepts_of_flexbox) - This page was helpful to understand Flexbox as well.
